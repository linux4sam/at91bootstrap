# AT91Bootstrap 3.99.x (Glasnost Edition)

This repository is a fork of the original [AT91Bootstrap](https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap) project by Microchip, adapted for the Glasnost boards and modernized with a new build system and versioning scheme.

> **Note:** This fork was created because the 3.x series is no longer supported by upstream.

## What's Changed

- **Modern Build System:** The build system has been reworked for improved maintainability and ease of use.
- **Glasnost Board Support:** Fixes and enhancements for reliable operation on Glasnost hardware.
- **New Versioning:** Releases now follow the `3.99.x` scheme to distinguish from upstream and indicate ongoing development.

## About AT91Bootstrap

AT91Bootstrap is a 2nd level bootloader for Microchip (formerly Atmel) AT91 microprocessors. It handles hardware initialization (clocks, PIO, DRAM, etc.) and loads the main application from various boot media (NAND, DataFlash, EEPROM, SD Card, etc.) into main memory.

For full documentation, usage instructions, and supported boards, see the [official AT91Bootstrap repository](https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap) and [project wiki](https://www.linux4sam.org/bin/view/Linux4SAM/AT91Bootstrap).
